# nordvpn-zenity

Just a **simple** "GUI" for the NordVPN Linux Client.

This folder contains all files needed to run the GUI on Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition.

Despite not being tested on other Linux Desktops I believe it should work in other environments as long as the "**gnome-terminal**" package is installed and working.

## Prerequisites

- Zenity: `sudo apt install zenity`
- gnome-terminal
