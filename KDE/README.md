# nordvpn-zenity

Just a **simple** "GUI" for the NordVPN Linux Client.

This folder contains all files needed to run the GUI on KDE.

Despite not being tested I believe it should work in other environments as long as the "**konsolel**" package is installed and working.

## Prerequisites

- Zenity: `sudo apt install zenity`
- konsole
