# nordvpn-zenity

Just a **simple** "GUI" for the NordVPN Linux Client.

The initial idea of this project is to be a simple and uncomplicated solution for those who have difficulty (or don't like) using NordVPN's CLI client for Linux.

It's basically a common launcher/shortcut (.desktop) file and a shell script (.sh) file wrote with [Zenity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenity).

As there are several flavors of desktops for linux, the user must use the script (.sh) and the shortcut (.desktop) that are more adherent/compatible with their graphical environment.

## Prerequisites 

- Zenity: `sudo apt install zenity`
